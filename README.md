# Receipt assistant app

## Introduction

Created an assistant app that records grocery items into excelsheet. It was purposed for my own usage but to share if necessary.

Didn't think about it but with this app, I can create my own data and then use it for visualization or analysis.

## Software used

```bash
Python --version              3.11.5 (anaconda environment 23.7.4)
Pandas                        2.2.0
